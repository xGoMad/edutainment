edutainement
============

Series of files for e-learning, using the SCORM specification, the JQuery libraries and an XML file as the exercise basis.

Some notes ...

Because it is meant to be used as a SCORM package and therefore potentially used offline, all libraries are included in a folder and imported by relative path.

... and a TODO list

- Implement various types of exercises, available throughout libraries and the XML file.

- - Matching
- - Cloze
- - Word / phrase selection (as buttons)

- Make room for more appropriate feedback = feedback corresponding to each answer, rather than the plain stupid "yes that's good" or "no try again".
